Step 1.  Machine Learning Tests without any missing value:
	-Turning the class label type from string to int
	-Making test with RapidMiner and Weka (RapidMiner and Weka steps and accuracy scores will be added later)
	-Maintaining the python code including machine learning algorithms and finding out which algorithm has the best accuracy

Step 2.  Recovery of the missing values using ML algorithms:
	-Initially, the data has no missing value, therefore I made our missing values by myself. I removed some rows on one of the feature columns. For example: A, B, C and D are the column names. First, I created some missing values on A and make predictions by using ML algorithms. And this process went on the same on the other columns.
	-When creating missing values, I didn't lose the real data so that I can calculate the accuracy.
	-In the end, I determined the best algorithm , in other words the algorithm that has the highest accuracy score.

Step 3. Compare organic data with synthetic data
	-I chose the column which has the highest accuracy when using ML algorithms to fill their missing values; so that I had a synthesised data set without any missing value
	-I've tested this synthetic data set with the same ML algorithms in the previous steps.
	-Finally, I compared the accuracy results
